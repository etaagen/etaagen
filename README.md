### Hi there, I'm Ellie  

- ðŸ“Š Iâ€™m a Data Scientist at Bayer, where I primarily work in the areas of experimentation with high-dimensional data, developing data management pipelines, and creating dashboards to automate decisions and promote data fluency.  
- ðŸ’¼ I have over 8 years of experience using data science to solve real-world problems in commercial Life Science R&D and academic research, and I continuously seek to learn from new fields.  
- ðŸš€ I am proficient in data querying with **SQL**, and scripting with **Python** and **R** (but I like learning other stuff, too).  
- ðŸ§  I get curious about designing experiments, applying relevant statistical analysis to make sense of complex data, using machine learning to ID key patterns, and leveraging predictive models to understand probable future outcomes.  
- ðŸŽ¨ I get creative developing custom visualization and dashboards for data-driven communication with tools like **ggplot** and **Shiny**.  
- ðŸ¤— I enjoy teamwork and interdisciplinary collaborations - let's connect! [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ellie-taagen/)
